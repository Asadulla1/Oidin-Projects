      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>
        This is the best prime rib I've ever eaten or made. I will not even
        order from a restaurant anymore. Add any other seasonings to your taste.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
      <li>
        3 pounds prime rib roast, ribs removed and trussed onto roast, or more
        to taste
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Cooking Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a rack inside a
        roasting pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix garlic powder, onion powder, dill weed, pepper, and salt together in
        a bowl; rub onto roast, including the ribs. Place roast, rib-side down,
        onto rack in roasting pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake roast in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Turn off oven, keeping
        the door closed the entire time, and keep roast in oven for 3 hours.
        Turn oven back to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and cook roast until an
        internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) is reached, 30
        minutes more.
